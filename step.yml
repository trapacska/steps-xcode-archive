  Run Xcode Archive command and then Export an IPA from the archive
  for iOS, tvOS or watchOS.

  You can share it, upload it, deploy it and catch them
  all! Well, maybe not the last one.

      description: |-
        (optional) The configuration to use. By default, your Scheme
        defines which configuration (Debug, Release, ...) should be used,
        but you can overwrite it with this option.

        **Make sure that the Configuration you specify actually exists
        in your Xcode Project**. If it does not (for example, if you have a typo
        in the value of this input), Xcode will simply use the Configuration
        specified by the Scheme and will silently ignore this parameter!
  - export_method: "auto-detect"
    opts:
      title: "Select method for export"
      summary: ""
      description: |-
        `auto-detect` option is **DEPRECATED** - use direct export methods!

        Describes how Xcode should export the archive.

        If you select `auto-detect`, the step will figure out proper export method
        based on the provisioning profile embedded into the generated xcodearchive.
      value_options:
      - "auto-detect"
      - "app-store"
      - "ad-hoc"
      - "enterprise"
      - "development"
  - team_id:
    opts:
      title: "The Developer Portal team to use for this export"
      summary: ""
      description: |-
        The Developer Portal team to use for this export.

        Optional, only required if you want to use a different team for
        distribution, not the one you have set in your Xcode project.

        Format example:

        - `1MZX23ABCD4`
  - compile_bitcode: "yes"
    opts:
      title: "Rebuild from bitcode"
      summary: ""

        For __non-App Store__ exports, should Xcode re-compile the app from bitcode?
      value_options:
      - "yes"
      - "no"
  - upload_bitcode: "yes"
    opts:
      title: "Include bitcode"
      summary: ""
      description: |-
        For __App Store__ exports, should the package include bitcode?
      value_options:
      - "yes"
      - "no"
  - icloud_container_environment:
    opts:
      title: "iCloud container environment"
      summary: ""
      description: |-
        If the app is using CloudKit, this configures the "com.apple.developer.icloud-container-environment" entitlement.  
        Available options vary depending on the type of provisioning profile used, but may include: Development and Production.
  - force_team_id:
    opts:
      category: Force Build Settings
      title: "Force code signing with Development Team"
      description: |-
        Used for Xcode version 8 and above.

        Force xcodebuild to use the specified Development Team (DEVELOPMENT_TEAM).

        Format example:

        - `1MZX23ABCD4`
  - force_code_sign_identity:
    opts:
      category: Force Build Settings
      title: "Force code signing with Code Signing Identity"
      description: |-
        Force xcodebuild to use specified Code Signing Identity (CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY).

        Specify Code Signing Identity as full ID (e.g. `iPhone Developer: Bitrise Bot (VV2J4SV8V4)`)
        or specify code signing group ( `iPhone Developer` or `iPhone Distribution` ).

        You also have to **specify the Identity in the format it's stored in Xcode project settings**,
        and **not how it's presented in the Xcode.app GUI**!
        This means that instead of `iOS` (`iOS Distribution/Development`) you have to use
        `iPhone` (`iPhone Distribution` or `iPhone Development`).
        **The input is case sensitive**: `iPhone Distribution` works but `iphone distribution` does not!
  - force_provisioning_profile_specifier:
    opts:
      category: Force Build Settings
      title: "Force code signing with Provisioning Profile Specifier"
      description: |-
        Used for Xcode version 8 and above.

        Force xcodebuild to use specified Provisioning Profile (PROVISIONING_PROFILE_SPECIFIER).

        How to get your Provisioning Profile Specifier:

        - In Xcode make sure you disabled `Automatically manage signing` on your project's `General` tab
        - Now you can select your Provisioning Profile Specifier's name as `Provisioning Profile` input value on your project's `General` tab
        - `force_provisioning_profile_specifier` input value build up by the Team ID and the Provisioning Profile Specifier name, separated with slash character ('/'): `TEAM_ID/PROFILE_SPECIFIER_NAME`

        Format example:

        - `1MZX23ABCD4/My Provisioning Profile`
  - force_provisioning_profile:
    opts:
      category: Force Build Settings
      title: "Force code signing with Provisioning Profile"
      description: |-
        Force xcodebuild to use specified Provisioning Profile (PROVISIONING_PROFILE).

        Use Provisioning Profile's UUID. The profile's name is not accepted by xcodebuild.

        How to get your UUID:

        - In xcode select your project -> Build Settings -> Code Signing
        - Select the desired Provisioning Profile, then scroll down in profile list and click on Other...
        - The popup will show your profile's UUID.

        Format example:

        - `c5be4123-1234-4f9d-9843-0d9be985a068`
  - custom_export_options_plist_content:
    opts:
      category: Debug
      title: "Custom export options plist content"
      description: |-
        Used for Xcode version 7 and above.

        Specifies a custom export options plist content that configures archive exporting.
        If empty, the step generates these options based on provisioning profile,
        with default values.

        Auto generated export options available for export methods:

        - app-store
        - ad-hoc
        - enterprise
        - development

        If the step doesn't find an export method based on the provisioning profile, the development method will be used.

        Call `xcodebuild -help` for available export options.

    opts:
      category: Debug
